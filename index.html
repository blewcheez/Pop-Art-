           <!-- Brief History of what Pop Art is-->
          <h2 class="Head2"> Pop Art </h2>

          <p class="Yerr"> Pop art is a unique art style movement which occured in the 1950's and late 1960's which had a huge impact on society. 
            In todays world we can see the influences of the pop art movement style and cadence in the use of graphic design and advertising. Pop art 
            is decribes a certain genre of art that emerged as a movement in 1950 and further sprouted in American also Britian. The art movement draws 
            inspirtation from sources in popular and commercial culture. Different cultures and countried later contributed to the movement during the 60's and 70's. 
          </p> 

          <h2 class="Head2"> America's Pop vs Britain's Pop </h2>
 
          <p class="Yerr"> What's the difference between American pop art and Britain you ask? American artists that were involved in the 
            movement were inspired by their environment they lived in as well as what they saw from day to day experiences just by 
            lviing in America. American pop art is created in a stylistic way that was an omage to the representational art form that 
            came before it. In other words, art that depicted the world in a recognisable way. This involved using hard edges and 
            painterly looseness of abstract expressionism. By using monotonus imagery, pop artists wanted to move away from 
            the emphasis on feelings and symbolism that characterized abstract expressions when creating such art pieces.

          <p class="Yerr">
            Britian's pop movement took a more academic approach. Although britain implementd irony and parody into it's work, focused more on 
            what American popular imagery represented. Often self-aware, Most of these artowrks celebrated youth culture at the time. Celebrations 
            of comic-books, posters, and imagery drawing from funfairs, the circus and wrestling matches.

          <h2 class="Head2"> Notable Artists </h2>

          <h3 class="H3"> Eduardo Paolozzi </h3>

          <p class="Yerr2"> Paolozzi, a Scottish sculptor and artist, was a key member of the British post-war avant-garde. His collage I Was a Rich Man's Plaything 
            proved an important foundational work for the Pop Art movement, combining pop culture documents like a pulp fiction novel cover, a Coca-Cola advertisement
            , and a military recruitment advertisement. The work exemplifies the slightly darker tone of British Pop Art, which reflected more upon the gap between the
            glamour and affluence present in American popular culture and the economic and political hardship of British reality. As a member of the loosely associated
            Independent Group, Paolozzi emphasized the impact of technology and mass culture on high art. His use of collage demonstrates the influence of Surrealist 
            and Dadaist photomontage, which Paolozzi implemented to recreate the barrage of mass media images experienced in everyday life.

          <h3 class="H3"> Richard Hamilton </h3>

          <p class="Yerr2"> Hamilton's collage was a seminal piece for the evolution of Pop Art and is often cited as the very first work of the movement. Created for 
            the exhibition This is Tomorrow at London's Whitechapel Gallery in 1956, Hamilton's image was used both in the catalogue for the exhibition and on posters 
            advertising it. The collage presents viewers with an updated Adam and Eve (a body-builder and a burlesque dancer) surrounded by all the conveniences modern
            life provided, including a vacuum cleaner, canned ham, and a television. Constructed using a variety of cutouts from magazine advertisements, Hamilton created
            a domestic interior scene that both lauded consumerism and critiqued the decadence that was emblematic of the American post-war economic boom years.

            <h3 class="H3"> Roy Lichtenstein </h3>

          <p class="Yerr2"> In the early 1960s, Lichtenstein gained renown as a leading Pop artist for paintings sourced from the popular comics. Although artists such as 
            Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns had previously integrated popular imagery into their works, no one hitherto had focused on cartoon imagery as exclusively 
            as Lichtenstein. His work, along with that of Andy Warhol, heralded the beginning of the Pop Art movement, and, essentially, the end of Abstract Expressionism as the dominant style.
            Lichtenstein did not simply copy comic pages directly, he employed a complex technique that involved cropping images to create entirely new, dramatic compositions, 
            as in Drowning Girl, whose source image included the woman's boyfriend standing on a boat above her. Lichtenstein also condensed the text of the comic book panels, 
            locating language as another, crucial visual element; re-appropriating this emblematic aspect of commercial art for his paintings further challenged existing views
             about definitions of "high" art.As with the rest of Pop Art, it is often unclear whether Lichtenstein is applauding the comic book image, and the general cultural sphere to which it belongs, or 
            critiquing it, leaving interpretation up to the viewer. But in Drowning Girl, the ridicule of the woman's situation (as is made clear by her ridiculous statement) is evident.

            <h3 class="H3"> Andy Warhol </h3>

            <p class="Yerr2"> Warhol's iconic series of Campbell's Soup Cans paintings were never meant to be celebrated for their form or compositional style, like that of the abstractionists.
              What made these works significant was Warhol's co-opting of universally recognizable imagery, such as a Campbell's soup can, Mickey Mouse, or the face of Marilyn Monroe, and depicting
              it as a mass-produced item, but within a fine art context. In that sense, Warhol wasn't just emphasizing popular imagery, but rather providing commentary on how people have come to
              perceive these things in modern times: as commodities to be bought and sold, identifiable as such with one glance. This early series was hand-painted, but Warhol switched to screenprinting 
              shortly afterwards, favoring the mechanical technique for his mass culture imagery. 100 canvases of Campbell's soup cans made up his first solo exhibition at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles,
              and put Warhol on the art world map almost immediately, forever changing the face and content of modern art.

              <h2 class="Head2"> History </h2>

              <h3 class="H3"> Early Beginnings</h3>

              <p class="Yerr2"> 
                In 1952, a gathering of artists in London calling themselves the Independent Group began meeting regularly to discuss topics such as mass culture's place in fine art, the found object, 
                and science and technology. Members included Eduardo Paolozzi, Richard Hamilton, architects Alison and Peter Smithson, and critics Lawrence Alloway and Reyner Banham. Britain in the early
                1950s was still emerging from the austerity of the post-war years, and its citizens were ambivalent about American popular culture. While the group was suspicious of its commercial character,
                they were enthusiastic about the rich world pop culture seemed to promise for the future. The imagery they discussed at length included that found in Western movies, science fiction, comic books,
                billboards, automobile design, and rock and roll music.The actual term "Pop Art" has several possible origins: the first use of the term in writing has been attributed to both Lawrence Alloway
                and Alison and Peter Smithson, and alternately to Richard Hamilton, who defined Pop in a letter, while the first artwork to incorporate the word "Pop" was produced by Paolozzi. His collage I 
                as a Rich Man's Plaything (1947) contained cut-up images of a pinup girl, Coca-Cola logo, cherry pie, World War II bomber, and a man's hand holding a pistol, out of which burst the world "POP!"
                in a puffy white cloud.
